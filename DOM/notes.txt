inner html supports html tag in dom and.Show all the text(hidden or unhidden) in the target element and show all the html tags within the target element
inner text shows all the text visisble on the screen but not the hidden text.
text context shows all the text(hidden and visible).


It is easy to manipulate dom if we know how to select that element and how to take values from that element.

Major difference between query selector and query selector all is the datatype they return. Query selector all returns a node list.

A node list is a list but it is not an array. It has some properties of an array like for each and way to access element is similar to that of an array 
but still it is not an array.
